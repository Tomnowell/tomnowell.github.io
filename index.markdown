This site contains some projects I have created and a collection of ramblings and documentation of part of my learning journey. My aim is for it to provide a simple means of contact and a bridge between my neglected social media accounts and what I aim to be a regular blog.  

When I have time, I am currently working through the Try Hack Me SOC level 2 learning pathway rooms. I'd be very glad if you check out my [blog](https://tomnowell.github.io/blog/). I hope you like it!
