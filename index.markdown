Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm Tom, nope not the Tom that broke Production last week. I'm a father of 2, a language teacher, and a recent Computer Science MSc graduate.

This site contains some projects I have created and a collection of ramblings and documentation of part of my learning journey. My aim is for it to provide a simple means of contact and a bridge between my neglected social media accounts and what I aim to be a regular blog.
