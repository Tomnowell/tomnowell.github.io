## Hello

I am a language teacher, software developer, cyber security learner and recently, a father. I live in Southern Kyushu in Japan. I'm a keen musician - I play the guitar, piano and violin and sing whenever I get the chance. I enjoy running, playing soccer and tennis. I speak English fluently and consider myself somewhat of a grammar nerd (but not a grammar snob). I speak some Japanese at a roughly intermediate level although I am trying to improve.

I'm currently reading Computer Science (MSc) at York University (U.K.) on the side.

A note for the curious: All the cartoon art that title the blog posts on this site were drawn to my prompts by AI. So far they are all creations of Microsoft's Bing image creator which is powered by versions of OpenAI's Dall-E.
