## Hello

I am a language teacher, software developer, and recent Computer Science Master's degree graduate, aspiring cyber security professional and a father of two. I live in Kagoshima in southern Kyushu in Japan. I'm a keen musician. I play the guitar, piano and violin and sing whenever I get the chance. I enjoy running, playing soccer and tennis. I speak English fluently and Japanese to an intermediate level. I like reading, cooking and, along with most of the human race, eating.
