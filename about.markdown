## Hello

I am a language teacher, software developer, master's degree student, aspiring cyber security professional and recently, a father. I live in Southern Kyushu in Japan. I'm a keen musician - I play the guitar, piano and violin and sing whenever I get the chance. I enjoy running, playing soccer and tennis. I speak English fluently and Japanese to an intermediate level. I like reading, cooking and along with most of the human race, eating.
