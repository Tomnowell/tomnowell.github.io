I admit, I may be a little late to the game of using AI for coding. I intentionally limited my use of AI while studying my Master's degree which I have been doing part-time for the past 3 years (along with a full time job and 2 very young kids). I didn't want issues of plagiarism or non-authentic work to enter my submissions and I also needed to understand what I was doing. That last point is the TL;DR for this post.

Since finishing my degree and while I still have student status (and therefore get it for free), I have been using Github CoPilot which, in turn utilises ChatGPT5, Claude Sonnet (various versions) and other LLMs to provide both inline auto-complete and *chat* and *agentic* modes. Which, I'm sure you already know. It's me who's been under a rock.

When I first started using CoPilot I actually thought it was magic. I made a tic-tac-toe game on the command line in under 5 minutes with custom min-max algorithm. I realise that's a solved problem, but it's one that I've wanted to figure out since I tried to do it aged 16 between GCSE exams on my Texas Instruments TI-83 calculator. Ahhh, nostalgia.

I found I could get all the boring bits of fun projects done really quickly and painlessly. Stuff like UI and CSS (peh!) stuff, I really don't enjoy. Note, I don't want to disparage anyone who does UI or works in CSS/HTML for a living.  It's hard, and it's not the kind of hard that I like. I enjoy cooking, but I don't particularly like making cakes or pastries. I love eating them though, and I love a good UI or well layed-out website, I just don't want to be the one who does it. 

Okay, little side-quest ramble over. I found while using AI to do the bits that I don't enjoy, I frequently let it loose on problems that I was actually interested in fixing if I couldn't reach a solution soon. This was a serious error of judgement and one I shall be careful not to repeat.

In my desire to leave Microsoft Windows for good, I've been using a Mac. I think there's too much advertising on my paid *Pro* **[sic]** Windows version and I don't want the up-coming mandatory *recall* feature. Even if it's currently all on-device.
