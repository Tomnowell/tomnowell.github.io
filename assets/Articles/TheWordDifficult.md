# Thoughts on the Word 'Difficult'

## Overused and paralyzing

### What do you mean?

A concept that has become clear to me over the past two or so years, is that the word 'difficult' is both overused and paralyzing.

Working as an English language teacher has given me an insight into how people deal with difficulty. I can see which students excel and those that get stuck. I don't want to be too judgemental. There are many factors that determine ability. But one common factor that most 'stuck' students share is their use of the adjective 'difficult' to describe English in general. The word has a paralyzing effect on their brain and they switch focus from the mental effort of trying to remember words and patterns to make parts of sentences to the mental effort of thinking that the task is too difficult.

### The teacher is a student

I humbly admit that I am not the best language teacher. While I often don't have control of the class flow (due to team teaching or seniority hopefully not lack of skill). I freely admit that at some points the material presented is 'too hard'. The mental effort needed to process the new information is just too great and that is a failure by us, the teachers.

But, often the words 'English is difficult' crop up in classes and serve as an excuse not to try, not to continue or not to engage. Yes, English is not 'easy'. No language is. It's full of grammar booby-traps and pronunciation pitfalls not to mention
cultural hangovers that most native speakers take for granted. English is not easy. Neither is German, or Hindi or Japanese. Communication is hard, but it's worth it.

I wish I had understood this lesson when I was younger. I'm sure someone tried to tell me, probably many people. But I didn't, and probably couldn't have, understood. Perhaps this is a lesson we get to learn as teachers. Whether you get the experience young or not. If you've got it, you've got it. Let me know if you have had a similar epiphany, or if you totally disagree. I am often wrong.

While difficult is a fine word. I would like to save it to describe truly difficult things like climate change reduction, pandemic control and traveling sales-person problems rather than as an impediment to learning.

### Actions not just words

Okay, so it's all very well to say: "It's not difficult". But isn't that just semantics. Well, yes and no. My point is that the word 'difficult' represents a condition. In saying "this is difficult" we give our energy-saving brain a way out. This is usually all sub-concious and I am not a psychotherapist I am just speaking from my own experience. If given a choice between engaging, thinking and ultimately burning more calories or bunking off, my brain at least naturally bunks off. So yes, this is a kind-of trick, but I like to think of it as 'reframing'. Reframe that 'difficult problem' as an interesting challenge. In doing so the brain engages more and the reward on completion is that much better. It's no fun slogging through hard problems just to get to the end, and then what? Reframed as a challenge there is a goal and once you hit it, solve it, do it, you'll get a nice dopamine reward and you'll want to do it again. 

Careful with this 'trick' it's powerful and you will not want to stop learning and challenging yourself. Sure exams suck. Sometimes coursework sucks. Sometimes teachers are awful. But you be the best you and don't worry about what's out of your control. Thinking is totally within your control and you can do it!
