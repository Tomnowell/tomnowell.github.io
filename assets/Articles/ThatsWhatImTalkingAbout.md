# That's What I'm Talking About

## The What, Why and Where and a little How

I'm on a journey to equip myself with all the knowledge and skills I can especially in the areas of computer science and related disciplines that I enjoy most - cyber security and software engineering. I hope you can join me on the journey for some of the way, at least.

### Where I started
Well, years ago really. I could ramble for a long time about old computers that I've used or owned or somehow interacted with. But that would be too long and boring for anyone to actually read. My family's first computer was an Archimedes Acorn A3000 computer back in the early 1990s - it was pretty baller for the time. It had a snazzy GUI, a floppy disk drive (but no hard drive) and several MB of ram. Risk OS 3.0 shipped with the computer on ROM chips but at some point we upgraded the OS by ordering new ROM chips by snail-mail and then swapping them out when the new ones arrived. My guess is if the rom chips were 32KB then over the 14 days they took to arrive that's a download speed of about 0.0271 bytes a second.

### Where I've Been
I studied a music related degree as an undergraduate and spent a long time working in various jobs often involving fermentation, especially alcohol and my favourite, wine. I've been a wine maker and technical assistant measuring soil composition and sugar and acidity in grapes to determine the optimal picking time. Careful analysis is so important in growing grapes and also in winemaking. Analysis of the fermentation process is key to controlling flavour and ultimately quality. So, while this isn't a resume I'd like to show that I am attentive to detail.

I rekindled my desire to get into computing by studying a couple of MOOCS (massive open online courses) First a couple of Python courses from MIT and also CS50 from Harvard. Thanks David Malan and team! If you haven't already, do check out CS50 - it's a great intro to computer science and I think offers a really good balance of challenge and fun for someone starting their journey.

In 2021, after completing CS50, I thought the next step would be to learn some cloud compute platform as that seemed to be where all companies were focussed. Microsoft were running a super deal for anyone affected by COVID-19 (which was everyone in the world) and you could take a real, proctored, bone-fide Azure exam for just 10USD. As I was already using Azure for a little project I was doing I thought I would lean into it and study it more. I heavily utilised Microsoft Learn platform which is fantastic. I did 'audit' Coursera's Azure 204 exam prep course which mostly uses Microsoft Learn materials but there was an iOS app so I could listen to lessons on my commute while driving. 

### Where I am
Passing he AZ204 exam and becoming an *Microsoft Certified Microsoft Azure Developer Associate* gave me the confidence to sign up for a MSc in Computer Science which I have now almost finished. 

I'd like to say a few words about studying a degree, especially a master's, and particularly online. It is *not* the best experience.  There's a lot you miss by doing something purely online - the social aspect, quick feedback, meetings with mentors or course supervisors. I'm sure some MSc courses are better than others and also some people do not need those things. Perhaps I am one of those people. I seem to be doing alright, but I do appreciate feedback and the level I get on this course is not very useful.

A master's degree often implies less tutor contact time and a *lot* of self study. That is very important and I think one reason why I simply could not have done this degree 10 years ago. I didn't have the self-discipline to study that intensely. But some people do. If you are a young twenty-something and you have that self-control I salute you! 

I don't think that a degree will *teach* you more than other methods. Degrees are expensive and often focus more on academic achievement rather than practical skills. You have to learn (or know) how to write an academic report or essay or dissertation. Referencing all work is super important and practical skills can get overlooked almost completely. 

I remember being surprised while listening to a podcast (I believe it was the StackExchange podcast but I might be wrong) where one presenter who also has a software development company was discussing hiring graduates from a computer science degree and his interviewee said 'I can't code.' I was surprised at the time, but after studying all taught modules of a CS degree - I can almost see how that is possible. I really love programming in Python, C# and Java and I'm quite happy to get stuck in an learn another language (unless it's Javascript *jk*) but other students on the course really don't enjoy it and while it's a requirement to pass two modules that actually require some coding - I can sympathise with someone who says - nah, it's not for me. 

### Where I'm going

To the moon!!! Well, who knows. Maybe one day. Nah, I had a baby this year and I want more. While in the past I have only been studying and developing for my own benefit, curiosity and satisfaction. I now find myself with a fast growing, hungry 6 month old (he's always hungry because he's growing fast - we do feed him, I promise!!), a desire for more kids, and existential dread about not having the capital to give them at least as good an education as I had.


### So Join Me
On my trip to the moon, we may never get there but what sights we'll see along the way - I'm kicking off the blog series with some commentary on what I'm studying at the moment which is computer and network security with TryHackMe. My subscription expires at the end of November so I may pivot away unless I can make the blog pay for it.  Please let me know what you'd like to see. I also live in Japan so I may make a series about fun things to do in Japan.
