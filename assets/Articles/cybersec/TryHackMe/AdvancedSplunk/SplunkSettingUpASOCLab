# Splunk: Setting Up a SOC Lab

## Explore Splunk Beyond Basics

## SOC Level 2 Learning Pathway

### Introduction

This sounds really exciting we get to install Splunk and set it up on a Linux box and a Windows box! Let's get started!

You can connect to this room's VMs via the browser, which is what I did. I like to full screen the browser and put it on a different desktop so that I can (in Windows) just press ctrl+Win and arrow keys to go between the VM and the room page. Unfortunately THM didn't provide RDP or ssh credentials. I'd like to at least have ssh for installation and interacting with the CLI. The lag on the terminal in the browser is painful, but it's a minor complaint.

### Task2 - Splunk: Setting up a Lab

This is more like a continued introduction. Let's proceed!

### Task 3 - Splunk: Deployment on Linux Server


_Note:_ There are two VMs for this room and I recommend setting some time aside to work through all the steps on each machine in one go. The reason being that later tasks rely on work performed in previous tasks. Eg. Task 6 - configuring the forwarder on linux requires the installation steps performed in task 2. It took me about an hour each to work through the machines while taking notes. I consider myself on the slow side, especially while learning - so you may be able to get through much faster.

_Here are the steps:_
> cd Downloads/splunk
> sudo su
> tar xvzf splunk_installer.tgz
> mv splunk /opt/
> cd /opt/splunk/bin
> ./splunk start --accept-license
> \# Go ahead and create a user account
> \# Wait for setup
> Access your splunk instance on:
> http://coffely:8000
> Or if you're using the VPN http://VM_IP_ADDRESS:8000
> Sign in with the credentials you made on installation

*Q1: What is the default port for Splunk?*

> We can see the port used to access splunk after the : in the splunk URL

    8000

### Task 4 - Splunk: Interacting with CLI

We'll go back to the terminal for interacting with the CLI and stay as root. Or if you aren't root then:

> sudo su 

Move to the main splunk directory to run CLI commands:

> cd /opt/splunk

If you haven't started splunk already you can run start from here:

> ./bin/splunk start

And stop like so:

> ./bin/splunk/stop

I won't list all the CLI instructions you can use - but do note them, understand them and consider how and when you might need to use them! Have a look at the help command and get used to using it. Notably we can run:

> ./bin/splunk help [command]

To get help on any individual command. Nice!

*Q1: In Splunk, what is the command to search for the term coffely in the logs?*

> We can see how to run a search query in the task information

<details>

  <summary>Spoiler warning: Answer</summary>
    
    ./bin/splunk search coffely

</details>


*Use the help command to explore different help options and their syntax.*

> No answer needed



### Task 5 - Splunk: Data Ingestion

For data ingestion we're introduced to forwarders. These come in two varieties: Heavy forwarders and universal forwarders. Heavy forwarders apply a filter, analyse or modify the logs in some way before forwarding to the SIEM. Universal forwarders on the other hand are lightweight and just sends the log data from the host to the SIEM.

The forwarder is installed separately (of course) because it is designed to collect logs from a host machine and send them to the SIEM.

We only have on VM so we're going to install the forwarder here. Let's go!

I opened a new terminal for this but if you don't want to then navigate to the ubuntu user's Downloads/splunk folder

> cd /home/ubuntu/Downloads/splunk \# get to the splunk download
> sudo su \# If you're not already root
> tar xvzf splunkforwarder.tgz
> mv splunkforwarder /opt/
> cd /opt/splunkforwarder
> ./bin/splunk start --accept-license
> \# enter new credentials
> \# You may get an error that the management port is already bound
> \# Select y and set a new port number - I followed the example and chose 8090


*What is the default port, on which Splunk Forwarder runs on?*

> If you get the error that the port is already bound - it should show the default port.

### Task 6 - Configuring Forwarder on Linux

Change the VM_IP_ADDRESS to your VM's IP address...
> ./bin/splunk add forward-server VM_IP_ADDRESS:9997

> ./bin/splunk add monitor /var/log/syslog -index Linux_host

To view the inputs:
> /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/search/local/inputs.conf

> See the logs in splunk go to search and search the index Linux_host
> index="linux_host"

_Note:_ We don't need to change the time period as we're collecting this data now so past 24 hours default is fine.

> Not sure about this answer I added the auth.log file and the sourcetype for those logs was auth-too_small but that is not the answer - check the sourcetype for the other log file

*Follow the same steps and ingest /var/log/auth.log file into Splunk index Linux_logs. What is the value in the sourcetype field?*

<details>

  <summary>Spoiler warning: Answer</summary>
    
    syslog

*Create a new user named analyst using the command adduser analyst. Once created, look at the events generated in Splunk related to the user creation activity. How many events are returned as a result of user creation?*

> At first I misunderstood this question - I thought we need to add a user to splunk. But we need to add a user to splunkforwarder. Splunk doesn't accept the adduser command. This should have been my first warning.

> So, within splunkforwarder directory run
> adduser analyst
> Or any name you like - fill in the requested info for the new user
> If you set the time window to show only recent log entries - this is the easiest way to see which log entries were
> added as a result of the adduser command. They should be at the top of your log entries and all from the /var/log/auth.> log source.

  <summary>Spoiler warning: Answer</summary>
    
    6

*What is the path of the group the user is added after creation?*

> One of our log entries should give the answer to this question:
> coffely groupadd[38041]: group added to

<details>

  <summary>Spoiler warning: Answer</summary>
    
    /etc/group

</details>

That's the end of the Linux VM. *Phew* quite a lot to ingest. But all good fun!
