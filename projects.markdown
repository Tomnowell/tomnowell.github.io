I love making things and breaking things, too. Most of my projects are currently on hold as I complete a master's degree in Computer Science. Here's a couple of older projects:

### TicketyDo - An exercise in CI/CD - ToDo List with built-in Pomodoro
This is an ongoing project for a product that almost certainly doesn't need to exist, but I like consolidating organisational apps and this is going to be the app I wanted when I was studying and trying to raise a family and work a full-time job. It's also really fun to explore GitHub Actions with Render for CD. I've done Azure DevOps stuff before, but it's more interesting to spread it out over different providers.

### MacBox - Learning to Swift
A work in progress - this app is intended to provide a GUI for macOS virtualisation libraries. It's not shipped yet...but (maybe) coming soon:

### Il Pane - A Sourdough Hydration Calculator in C# for Windows

I wrote this simple bread dough hydration calculator in C# to replace a handy little iOS app that I used previously. The iOS app was not updated and eventually would no longer run on the current version of iOS. The application utilises a SQLite database to store recipes.

In the future I plan to use .NET to turn this into a multi platform mobile application. When time allows...

### T-Bay - A Django based Ebay Clone

Written to complete the *Commerce* challenge on Harvards online MOOC CS50 Web, this is my attempt at an ebay clone. While I feel quite comfortable using Python, this was my first attempt at using the Django framework. Good fun!
