### Welcome  

Hello and welcome to my blog. I write most of what I write for purely selfish reasons. When the subject matter is technical it helps me to consolidate and retain information, ensures I don't skip over the difficult stuff and serves as notes if I ever need to revisit a topic. When the subject matter is not technical, I hope it helps me to explore ideas and feelings that might not always be foremost in my conciousness. Either way, I hope that it can be helpful for someone, somewhere or make someone somewhere laugh, either through my profound wit or extreme foolishness.
